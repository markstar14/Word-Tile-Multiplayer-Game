Team Meeting Notes for Team t046 For Week 3/27/2014

Hi, Victoria,
For the first class we exchanged contact information, went over the project, struggled with trying to figure out how to synchronize and commit the files correctly, and decided to meet outside of class directly after our scheduled recitation time each week since we are super creative like that and were too lazy to figure out a different time that would work for all of us. So a really productive day it was!
Thanks,
--Mark
Dear Professor Alphonce,
During class this week we exchanged contact information, worked on how to synchronize and commit the files, worked out a time to meet outside of class, and assigned tests for each of us to do. Have a nice day.
