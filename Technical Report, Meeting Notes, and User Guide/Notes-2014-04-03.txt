Team Meeting Notes for Team t046For Week 4/4/2014
Prior to this meeting there were dozens of tests written, and during this lab period we talked about what was written so each member understood what was happening with the code. During the lab we asked for help fixing the boardConfiguration test and method so it would actually work properly. That took the majority of the time since it just decided to be magic and not work one way and then work that same way after a half hour of attempting different approaches. It was truly baffling. We will be meeting immediately after the lab so i can continue to explain what the code that I wrote does since there seems to be some confusion. Overall there was decent progress during this week and the required tests are very close to being done.
