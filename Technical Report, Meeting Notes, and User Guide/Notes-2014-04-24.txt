Dear Professor Alphonce and Victoria,

This weeks meeting went as followed:

-Du attempted to make the corners of the board random, but he misunderstood what was needed. So we need to fix that.

-He also worked on the random inventory, which seems to be correct.

-Kevin altered many of the methods from stage 1 so it can work better with the new functionality. He used the white board to explain his logic and how the new word recognition methods work.

-I brought up that he overwrote my place method which handled some of the old functionality, so I will have to redo that one. The functionality for some of the game ending criteria is gone now as well, so that will have to be added back.

-We spent a lot of time going over how endTurn() works now that Kevin changed some of the code.

-We asked Victoria about some confusion Joe had concerning valid words and ending a turn. 

-We discussed what each of us want to do in the next week now that more of are free from other commitments.

-We talked about the dictionary, since none of us have any idea how to get to it.

We talked about the GUI and how it should be made, and checked with Victoria about some questions we had about it.

-Assigned code for each of us do work on before the next class.

Thanks,
--Mark Starczewski Jr.
